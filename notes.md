# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes

Here's the short version for your regular, daily Git workflow:

Do work (add files, edit files, deleting files, renaming files, etc..) in a repository.

Add your work with git add filename.py or git add . to add everything in a folder.

Commit your work like git commit -m "adding this file"

Push your work with git push (this uploads all new commits to GitHub).
